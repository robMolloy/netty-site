              tailor my approach to you by taking into account your specific
              circumstances, and business environment where appropriate. My
              style is non-directive as this is most helpful in bringing about
              sustained change. At the core of my coaching is my belief that you
              have the resources you need; I will help you to find them. Where
              appropriate, Iâ€™ll suggest tools to help you to overcome your
              challenges. This approach will benefit you, your team and the
              business as a whole.
