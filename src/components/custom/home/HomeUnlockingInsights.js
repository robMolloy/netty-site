              Working together in a safe and trusting environment, my aim is to
              enable you to build a new awareness of yourself to give you the
              best possible chance of achieving your potential. I will help you
              to understand your patterns of behaviour and thinking, to see
              things from a new perspective, to enable you to step out of your
              comfort zone, move forward and create change.
